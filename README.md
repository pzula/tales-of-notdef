# Tales of âŒ§!
## A presentation at [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/) 2018 - [Watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fADc9lHwSMc)

The `script.rb` file is a basic script to illustrate how to find a character within a folder of
font files. This script is intended for learning a discovery, and as such contains no tests or class structure.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.4.0 or higher
- Bundler to install gems

## Installation

1. Clone this repo locally
2. run `bundle install` in the main folder of the repo

## Usage

1. Find the Unicode codepoint for the character for which you would like to find a supporting font. You can use [FileFormat.info](http://fileformat.info),
a search engine, or use Appendix A below for instructions on how to do it programatically.
2. Collect your font files into a folder
3. Execute the script like so: `ruby script.rb /your/font/folder/path/ 308D`

## Example output

For a folder containing the font files `SourceHansSerif-Bold.otf`, `SourceSerifPro-Bold.otf` and `SourceCodePro-Regular.otf`:

```
$ ruby script.rb /Users/pzula/bangbangcon/Fonts/ 308D
----------------
SourceHanSerif-Bold.otf contains 308D!
----------------

```

## Appendix A

If you already have the character in your pasteboard, here's a quick way to find the Unicode hex representation of the codepoint using the Ruby REPL, [irb](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-irb-to-explore-ruby).

```
irb(main):001:0> character = "a"
=> "a"
irb(main):002:0> character_code = character.unpack('U*').first
=> 97
irb(main):003:0> hex_unicode = "U+" << character_code.to_s(16).upcase.rjust(4, '0')
=> "U+0061"

```
